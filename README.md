## Overview
This repository consists of the source code for a small kernel I've been writing for PC-compatible machines based on Intel's famous i386 architecture. It is meant to be fast and lightweight and holds the goal of serving as a good form of teaching material for those interested in the design & philosophy of UNIX-like kernels.
